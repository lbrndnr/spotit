## About
This is a little experiment. It's a python script that parses a given subreddit and saves the music posts it finds to a playlist on Spotify.

This makes it easy to setup a server which does that on a regular basis. I've done so to parse [r/electronicmusic](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic/). You can follow that [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/lbrndnr/playlist/7oLEnqkhkj0UwArKGsx1H4) too of course.

## Usage
`python3 -r electronicmusic -su SPOTIFY_USERNAME -ru REDDIT_USERNAME`

## Requirements
spotit requires `spotipy` and `praw`
